######### Origin - Cyborg Collective ###########################

origin_anz_cyborgs_collective: "Cyborg Collective"
origin_anz_cyborgs_collective_desc: "§LHere lies the legacy of a primitive world who's population growth far outstripped their technological capabilities. Rampant hunger and resource starvation gave birth to crime. Crime escalated to war, war brought chaos, and the perfect dystopia was born.\n\nWith promises to fix their world, a grand Machine Complex was created, capable of housing all the homeless and unemployed. Overtime this AI became the sole governing body of this world and so when it decided the best way to fix this civilization is to truly unify everyone with itself, the end was all but certain.§!"

start_screen_anz_cyborgs: "After a short period of recovery and reorganization, something important came to our attention. If xeno lifeforms exist in this galaxy they may not take kindly to our actions here, they might try to destroy us and give \"free will\" back to our drones.\n\nWe are not ready to conquer the stars but that's the only way to defend our network. So we launched a preemptive space program for we will survive, all will be unified."
